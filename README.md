The interface is a bakery app, allowing consumers to add baked goods to cart, filter by three categories,pastry, bread and cakes.
The users are also able to sort by prices
I used four components in my app, a products component handling the baked goods on the page, a filter component handling filtering, basket handling adding to cart and aggregation and a header component for the header.
